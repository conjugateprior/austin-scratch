# TODO

* Make models record which engine was used to fit them
* Tests.  Mmmm, tests...
* Make a WF version that closely follows the RC(M) parameterisation (e.g. from Vermunt description)
* Figure out what to do with the canonical correlation parameter; maybe compute after estimation?
* Fit models with multidimensional theta; use orthogonalize function to rejig each cycle
* Fit statistics and diagnostics for WF models
* Get ourselves onto the NLP RView.
