# The austin Package

This package is designed to fit wordfish and wordscores models.  When
this code is done it will replace the package currently living on
r-forge.

Kindly *don't* try to install it yet.  It's a scratchpad and won't do what you want.

## TODO

* Make models record which engine was used to fit them
* More tests.  Mmmm, tests...
* Move from r-forge permanently
* Fit statistics and diagnostics
