Austin is a package for scaling models of count data, derived mostly
from work in political science on how political actors express policy
preferences using words.  Currently it implements the models

  * Wordscores (Laver, Benoit and Garry)
  * Wordfish (Proksch and Slapin, and Monroe and Maeda)

and their extensions.

It also contains a stock of word frequency data and some lightweight
machinery for dealing with word frequency matrices.
